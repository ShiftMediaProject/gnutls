The PKCS#12 password is "password".

Because of unclear license, they are not distributed with GnuTLS
currently.

See the PDF for information regarding the self tests.

The script "pkits" will invoke the simple scripts "pkits_crt",
"pkits_crl", "pkits_pkcs12", "pkits_smime" which will make sure that
certtool can parse those structures.

The script "pkits_test" will build NIST's tool to generate HTML for
tests.  It will start a Glade interface, and you should type
e.g. 'foo.html' and then 'Generate tables'.  Since GnuTLS supports
DSA, you should typically click on 'DSA signature verification' too.
The interface invokes "gnutls_test_entry" which verifies certificates
chains, after building them using "build-chain".  A sample output is
stored in the file "gnutls-nist-tests.html".

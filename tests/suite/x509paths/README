Because of unclear license, they are not distributed with GnuTLS
currently.

See the PDF for information regarding the self tests.  Particular
comments on individual tests below.  The 'XXX' marks real bugs.

Chain 15-18: We should succeed, the reason we don't is that we use
memcmp for DN comparisons.

Chain 19: This requires advanced verification that we don't support
yet. It requires to check that this path contains no revocation data.
We shouldn't make these tests.

Chain 31-32: The CRL is issued by a issuer without CRLSign
(non-)critical keyCertSign.  We don't check the CRL, so this is not a
real problem. This is easier to be supported now with the trust_list
that can verify CRLs on addition. (there is an issue there since the
CRLs that are being added are typically of an intermediate CA which
is not in the trust list to verify them)
